Introduction
============

`glyphx` is a next-generation Python plotting package with SVG-first rendering,
interactivity, beautiful themes, and auto-display across Jupyter, CLI, and IDEs.

It aims to be more intuitive and flexible than matplotlib.pyplot, while providing clear,
readable charts by default.
