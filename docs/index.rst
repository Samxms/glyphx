Welcome to GlyphX
==================

GlyphX is a modern, interactive, SVG-first plotting library for Python.

It offers an intuitive syntax, automatic rendering, interactive features (like zoom/pan, hover tooltips, and export), and works across **Jupyter notebooks**, **CLI**, and **IDEs** â€” all without requiring explicit `fig.show()` calls.

It's designed to be **cleaner, faster, and more capable than matplotlib.pyplot**, offering many advanced features right out of the box.

**Main Features**:
- SVG-based plotting with zoom/pan and JavaScript interactivity
- Automatic display in notebooks, IDEs, and CLI
- Themes, tooltips, animations, and grid layouts
- Advanced chart types: violin, swarm, facet, pair, and more
- Export charts to standalone HTML or images
- Built-in support for pandas DataFrames
